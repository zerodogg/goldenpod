[ADDED]	GoldenPod graphical configurator (gpconf)
[CHANGED] Now ignores lines that only contain whitespace in the podcasts.conf
	file.
[ADDED]	A help/support section to the manpage
[CHANGED] No longer calls curl with --retry-max-time

0.5
- - - -
[CHANGED] The message displayed when the file to be copied by --copy
	already existed to make it easier to read.
[FIXED]	Will now only print a newline if we're really in verbose mode.
	On systems that had DefaultVerbosity set to 1 and then ran
	GoldenPod with --silent would still get a newline printed
	to STDOUT.
[FIXED]	Will now accept some weird feeds (still valid XML)
	that has space between "url" and "=", ex: url = "blah"
	instead of url="blah".
[CHANGED] Some minor cosmetic changes to a few messages
[CHANGED] Now converts %20 to _
[CHANGED] Added a long range of audio file formats to the podcast filter
[CHANGED] Made some changes to the manpage to make it easier to understand
[CHANGED] Dry run now also supports standard (download) mode
[CHANGED] Now favours goldenpod's config files over bashpodder's when both
	exists.
[CHANGED] Now defaults to being verbose (only affects NEW installations,
	set DefaultVerbosity in the config to 0 to make it silent by default)

[CLEANUP] Cleaned up some of the code
[ADDED]	A --rmold function. Deletes N old podcasts where N is 4 or the number
	supplied to --files.
[FIXED]	If you supply a number to --files that is higher than the total number
	of podcasts then goldenpod will not continue to loop but will set the
	number to:
	- Total amount of podcasts minus one if working in --rmold
	- Total amount of podcasts if working in --copy
[CHANGED] Removed some redundant text from --help that is better covered
	in the manpage.
[CHANGED] Some minor changes to the manpage provided by Viking667
[CHANGED] Commented some of the code better
[CHANGED] Renamed the old --dry-run to --no-download
[ADDED]	A _NEW_ --dry-run that applies to --copy and --rmold:
	- Display what would be done, but don't actually do anything.
[FIXED]	Both --dry-run and --delete used the short option -d
	the new -dry-run uses -u, --no-download uses -w.
[CHANGED] Improved documentation for --ignore-pattern
[ADDED]	--stats, display some simple statistics
[CHANGED] Renamed /etc/goldenpod.conf to /etc/goldenpod-podcasts.conf
[FIXED]	Some grammar here and there *sigh*

0.3
- - - - -
[CHANGED] Minor changes to some comments in the config files
[CHANGED] The message printed when performing --copy and the file exists
[CHANGED] The short option for --copy is now -c (not -p)
[REMOVED] The --nocat option, was not really that useful. If you used it
	then please give some feedback about that and I'll bring it back.
[ADDED]	--ignore-pattern, regexp match to perform on files to copy/download.
	If it matches, goldenpod will not download or copy the file.
[ADDED]	A $IgnorePattern option in the configuration file. The same as
	--ignore-pattern (--ignore-pattern overrides this config option)
[CHANGED] The short option for --files is now -n (not -i)
[CHANGED] Now it doesn't display the help screen when invalid options
	or syntaxes for options are supplied, but tells you to run
	goldenpod --help for help.

0.2
- - - - -
[CHANGED] Minor code cleanups
[CHANGED] Now dies if you use --files without --copy
[ADDED]	Usage statement to --help
[FIXED]	Now doesn't download the same file twice
	with some weird feeds.
[CHANGED] goldenpod will now never rewrite the logfile, but add to it
	even when in --dry-run mode.
[CHANGED] Now the same entry _should_ never appear twice in the logfile.
[CHANGED] The help text for --verbose and --silent now reacts to your
	$DefaultVerbosity setting.
[CHANGED] Now attempts to run sync after copying.
[ADDED]	A PodcastFilter setting (set to 0 by default).
	- Makes sure goldenpod only downloads audio podcasts
[FIXED]	If a file in All doesn't exist, perl errors will not occur
[FIXED]	Made sure --first-only doesn't get put into the logfile if it fails
	to download.
