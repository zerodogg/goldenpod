# GoldenPod - a podcast client in perl

GoldenPod is a command line podcast client written in perl. It allows you to
easily manage and download podcasts from the command line. It can download
podcasts from standard RSS(-like) feeds, or it can attempt to parse any other
cleartext document (ie. XML or HTML) for a list of audio files and download
those.

Information on how to configure goldenpod can be found in the manpage. If
GoldenPod is installed globally on your system just type "man goldenpod", if
not then type either "man ./goldenpod.1" or "perldoc ./goldenpod".
