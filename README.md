# GoldenPod - a podcast client in perl

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.

GoldenPod is a command-line podcast client (or podcast aggregator, or
podcatcher, feel free to pick whichever name you want) written in perl.

It reads from configuration files in ~/.goldenpod, and saves podcasts to
the directory defined there (by default ~/Podcasts/). GoldenPod can both be used
manually, and automatically in --silent mode with cron.

Information on how to configure goldenpod can be found in the manpage. If
GoldenPod is installed globally on your system just type "man goldenpod" and
the manpage will happily pop up and tell you what you need, if not then type
either "man ./goldenpod.1" or "perldoc ./goldenpod" in the directory containing
the GoldenPod files and it'll (hopefully) pop happily up and (you guessed it)
tell you what you want to know.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please do so at

can do so by mailing me at eskild [aat] zerodogg [dot] org.

Thanks for using GoldenPod and hope it's useful.
